VizHash GD
==========

What is a visual hash ?
=======================

MD5 and SHA1 are common hashing function, which produce a binary or hex string. A visual hash works the same, but produces an image.

Like MD5 or SHA1:

* It takes an arbitrary, variable-size input.
* It's a one-way function.
* The image is unique to the input string (it's a fingerprint)
* A single bit of difference in the input string produces a totally different image.
* It's not possible to deduce the input string from the image.

Applications
============

* *File comparison*: If you need to compare files or commit hashes, comparing visual hashes is instant (much easier than comparing md5 or sha1).

* *Avatars*: VizHash can be used as an avatar in forums or blog comments. Simply hash the IP (or email) address and feed into VizHash and ou have a unique icon for each visitor, specific to its IP or email address. VizHash is used is [ZeroBin](https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin) discussions ([example](http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?b3d94022c526d402#T0faEej4u5xubp7d2+n9Xg1tIogj5McY99zP8D0120U)).

* *Protection against TabJacking*: VizHash could be used - for example - as a persona in Firefox to give a visual hint of the real domain the user is currently on.

* *Password check* : Make sure you typed the right password without displaying it on screen (à la Lotus Notes).

What is VizHash GD ?
====================

VisHash GD is an implementation of a visual hash in php. It is free software, under the zlib/libpng OSI licence.

Features:

* Can produce images up to 256×256.
* Visual hashes keep their visual features even if scaled (see examples below)
* Uses only php and basic GD (which are available almost everywhere). Does not use imagefilter GD functions (which are not available everywhere).
* Runs under php4 and php5.
* VizHash GD is not beautiful (no fractals, wavelets or high-end filters). It's designed to be fast, light on CPU and to produce images which are easy to differentiate.

You can [test it online](http://sebsauvage.net/vizhash_gd.php).

Other implementations
=====================

There are implementation of VizHash in other languages:

* Javascript version (by Sam & Max): https://github.com/sametmax/VizHash.js ([demo](http://jsfiddle.net/2nYsg/3/embedded/result/))
* jQuery password plugin (by Sam & Max): https://github.com/sametmax/jQuery-Visual-Password ([demo](http://jsfiddle.net/TANLB/light/))
* Java (by inouire):  https://github.com/inouire/VizHash4j

Note that these visual hashes are *close* to the php implementation, but may have some differences.
